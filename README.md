  ## Description
  Shaun's Note Taker is primarily a server-side app that allows users to write and save notes. The front end has been tied to the back end using Express.js to save/retrieve note data with a JSON file. The application is also deployed live to Heroku, making it easy for the user to keep track of their notes and tasks across multiple sessions.

  ## Installation
  If you wish to modify the app for your own usage, you'll want to install it first. To install, simply clone the repository and use command prompt "npm install". Invoke the application with the command prompt: “node index.js”. Express and Path are required, but are included as dependencies in the package.json file. Make sure the express server is running first by using the command prompt "npm start" if you wish to go this route. Otherwise, just visit the live deployed link in your favorite web browser!

  ## Usage
  Open the URL using your web browser, and click "Get Started" to view your saved notes. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner to add a new note. Enter the note title and main text, and click the Save icon at the top of the page to save the note to the database on the server. Click on an existing note in the left-hand column to edit and save the note the same way.
